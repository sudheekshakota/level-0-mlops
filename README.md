# level-0-mlops
Implementing Level 0 MLOps for a Penguin Species Classification Model using TFX and Vertex AI.

MLOps stands for machine learning operations and refers to the process of managing the machine learning life cycle, from development to deployment and monitoring.

### Primary benefits of MLOps
1. Efficiency: MLOps allows data teams to achieve faster model development, deliver higher quality ML models, and faster deployment and production.
2. Scalability: MLOps also enables vast scalability and management where thousands of models can be overseen, controlled, managed, and monitored for CI/CD.
3. Reproducibility: MLOps provides reproducibility of ML pipelines, enabling more tightly-coupled collaboration across data teams and accelerating release velocity.
4. Risk reduction: Machine learning models often need regulatory scrutiny and drift-check, and MLOps enables greater transparency and faster response to such requests and ensures greater compliance with an organization's or industry's policies.
